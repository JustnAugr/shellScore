# shellScore
written using http://api.football-data.org/index, a great API

##Description
A Python based project revolving around getting the scores, league, and player data for Football (or soccer) competitions around the world. Initially for personal use a means of staying updated on when my favorite teams are playing, and being able to easily find results at a few keystrokes.

##Use
Currently, just run the program and wait for it to load. When prompted you can enter a team/competition, and follow instructions from there. You can also enter a team/competition along with where you would like to go. 

For example:
`> Barcelona squad` would prompt you asking if Barcelona is the team you'd like, and it would then take you directly to a list of all their players.

Currently you can also enter parts of full team names and it will search through to find matching teams. So `> arse` would return both Arsenal and Marseille if you, when prompted, rejected the suggestion of Arsenal.
